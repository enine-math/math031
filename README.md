# Problem No. 31

## Coin Sums

In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:

> 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

> 1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

## Part A

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

Update the function `answer()` in `solution.py` with your solution.

## Part B

Generalize the solution in Part A to identify different ways to make any amount (£n)?

Update the function `solver()` in `solution.py` with your generalized solution.

## Instructions

Create a new directory in your math problem repo (math) called `math031`

Copy README.md and solution.py into `math031`

Share your solution by updating `answer()` and `solver()` in solution.py.
